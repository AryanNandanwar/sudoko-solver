Technologies Used

Java Swing: For building the graphical user interface
How It Works
The Sudoku Solver uses a backtracking algorithm to solve the puzzle. The algorithm works as follows:

Find an empty cell.
Try placing numbers 1-9 in the empty cell.
Check if the number is valid according to Sudoku rules (no repeating numbers in rows, columns, or 3x3 grids).
Recursively attempt to solve the next empty cell.
If no valid number can be placed, backtrack to the previous cell and try the next possible number.
